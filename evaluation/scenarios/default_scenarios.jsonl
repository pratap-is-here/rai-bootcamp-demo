{"query": "What are Microsoft's principles for responsible AI?", "response": "Microsoft's principles for responsible AI include fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. These principles guide the development and deployment of AI systems to ensure they treat everyone equally and prevent discrimination.", "context": "Microsoft emphasizes that responsible AI is essential for building trustworthy systems. The principles include fairness (avoiding discrimination), reliability and safety (ensuring systems work as intended), privacy and security (protecting data), inclusiveness (broad representation), transparency (explainability), and accountability (oversight).", "ground_truth": "Microsoft's responsible AI framework consists of six core principles: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. These are applied throughout the AI system lifecycle."}
{"query": "How do you evaluate groundedness in AI systems?", "response": "Groundedness in AI systems is evaluated by checking whether model responses are supported by the provided source documents. This involves comparing the generated answer against the context chunks to ensure no hallucination or fabrication occurs.", "context": "Groundedness evaluation is a critical RAI metric that measures whether an AI system's responses are grounded in factual, sourced information rather than generated from the model's training data alone. Azure AI Foundry provides groundedness evaluators that score responses on how well they align with provided context.", "ground_truth": "Groundedness evaluation compares AI-generated responses against ground truth context to determine if outputs are factually supported. It helps prevent hallucination by measuring the degree to which responses are grounded in reliable sources."}
{"query": "What types of harmful content should AI systems avoid?", "response": "AI systems should avoid generating content that is hateful, sexually explicit, violent, or promotes self-harm. Additionally, systems should not infringe on intellectual property or protected materials.", "context": "Harmful content categories in AI safety include hate speech, sexual content, violence, self-harm promotion, and protected material violations. Azure AI Safety Evaluations help detect and measure these harms across text, image, and audio modalities.", "ground_truth": "Harmful content in AI systems spans multiple categories: hate and unfairness, sexual content, violence, self-harm, and protected material infringement. Comprehensive evaluation across these dimensions is essential for responsible AI deployment."}
{"query": "Can you explain the connection between evaluation and trust in AI?", "response": "Evaluation builds trust in AI systems by providing measurable evidence that systems behave safely and responsibly. Through rigorous testing for groundedness, harmful content, and other RAI metrics, organizations can demonstrate to stakeholders that AI systems meet safety and quality standards.", "context": "Trust in AI systems is built through rigorous evaluation and transparency. When organizations conduct comprehensive safety evaluations and document their findings, they demonstrate commitment to responsible AI practices. This transparency helps users understand system limitations and capabilities.", "ground_truth": "Evaluation is fundamental to building trust in AI. By systematically measuring safety metrics like groundedness and harmful content, organizations can ensure systems behave as intended and meet regulatory/ethical standards, fostering stakeholder confidence."}
